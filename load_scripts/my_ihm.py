The AMI Meeting Corpus consists of 100 hours of meeting recordings. The recordings use a range of signals
synchronized to a common timeline. These include close-talking and far-field microphones, individual and
room-view video cameras, and output from a slide projector and an electronic whiteboard. During the meetings,
the participants also have unsynchronized pens available to them that record what is written. The meetings
were recorded in English using three different rooms with different acoustic properties, and include mostly
non-native speakers.

abstract = {The AMI Meeting Corpus is a multi-modal data set consisting of 100 hours of meeting
recordings. It is being created in the context of a project that is developing meeting
browsing technology and will eventually be released publicly. Some of the meetings
it contains are naturally occurring, and some are elicited, particularly using a scenario
in which the participants play different roles in a design team, taking a design project
from kick-off to completion over the course of a day. The corpus is being recorded
using a wide range of devices including close-talking and far-field microphones, individual
and room-view video cameras, projection, a whiteboard, and individual pens, all of
which produce output signals that are synchronized with each other. It is also being
hand-annotated for many different phenomena, including orthographic transcription,
discourse properties such as named entities and dialogue acts, summaries, emotions,
and some head and hand gestures. We describe the data set, including the rationale
behind using elicited material, and explain how the material is being recorded, transcribed
and annotated.},
